# Stoicism Highlights (Sample Notes)

## Key Principles
Stoicism teaches that we should focus on what we can control and accept what we cannot.
The external world is unpredictable, but our internal reactions are within our power.

### Dichotomy of Control
- **Within our control:** Thoughts, actions, responses.
- **Beyond our control:** Opinions of others, the past, outcomes.

## Quotes
> "You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."  
— Marcus Aurelius

> "We suffer more in imagination than in reality."  
— Seneca

## Applications
Stoicism is useful for:
- Reducing anxiety
- Improving decision-making
- Emotional resilience
- Avoiding overreaction to daily stress
