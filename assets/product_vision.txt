Cerebro is a local-first personal AI agent designed to run entirely on a user's computer.
The core vision is to enable private document understanding without sending data to the cloud.
Users can drop PDFs, notes, or entire folders and Cerebro will automatically ingest,
chunk, embed, and index them into a local vector database.

Key goals:
- Full privacy, default offline mode
- Instant semantic search over personal knowledge
- Automated daily summaries of watched folders
- RAG-based question answering across multiple documents
- Optional use of cloud LLMs with explicit permission

The app should feel fast, light, and trustworthy.
The user should always feel in control of their data.
